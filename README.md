# Well_Log_Analysis
Well Log Analysis for over 10 well logs

## Introduction

In this project, we will be exploring a well log dataset, with the aim of developing useful insights and 
sharpening our data wranking skills using majorly descriptive statistics and data visualization. 
We will equally be leveraging on physics-based equations and assumptions for better interpretations and insights.

## About the data

The 118 wells dataset spans the South and North Viking graben and penetrates a highly variable geology from the 
Permian evaporites in the south the the deeply buried Brent delta facies in the North. Some of samples of these 
well log datasets are from 118 wells in the Norwegian Sea that has been used in the FORCE 2020 machine learning 
competition with seismic and wells to predict the lithofacies using machine learning model.

Some of the well logs present in the well include;

## Research Questions

* How many lithofacies are present and what are their percentages?
* What is the Lithofacies content by GR api?
* Are there traces of hydrocarbon and which type is prevalent?
* How Lithofacies vary with respect to depth?
* What is the well trajectory for these samples?
* What are the hole damages by Lithofacies types and Depth?
* What is the mud weight loss w.r.t depth for the Lithofacies ?
